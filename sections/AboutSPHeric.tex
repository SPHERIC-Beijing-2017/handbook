SPHERIC, or ``SPH European Research Interest Community'', is the international organisation representing the community of researchers and industrial users of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), aims to promote the SPH method in both academic and industrial fields and enhance collaborations between countries and institutes. It was recognized as a Special Interest Group (SIG) within Ercoftac in January 2006.

As a purely Lagrangian technique, SPH enables the simulation of highly distorting fluids and solids. Fields including free-surface flows, solid mechanics, multi-phase, fluid-structure interaction and astrophysics where Eulerian methods can be difficult to apply represent ideal applications of this meshless method.

The SPH method was developed to study non-axisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics in the 1970s, but its application to engineering emerged in the 1990s and early 2000s. In the past twenty years the method has developed rapidly in many fields of application from impacts to fracture to breaking waves and fluid-structure interaction.

Following the impulse generated by a collection of local initiatives in 2005 (France, UK, Italy...), a need to foster and collaborate efforts and developments was identified. Since then, the SPHERIC organisation has gone on to push the development of the method forward providing a network of researchers and industrial users around the world as a means to communicate and collaborate.

\textbf{\Large SPHERIC Beijing 2017}

%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{SPHERIC Beijing 2017}
You are cordially invited to attend the 2017 SPHERIC Beijing International Workshop (SPHERIC Beijing 2017) to be held at Peking University (PKU) in Beijing China, from October, 17-20, 2017. This is the first time that the SPHERIC Workshop is held outside Europe.

The SPHERIC workshops are the only worldwide events which exclusively focus on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methodology and related simulation approaches. SPH has recently gained enhanced attention in the area of scientific computing. Exemplary applications refer to the development of galaxies in astrophysics, environmental engineering, applied solid mechanics, marine and coastal engineering, nuclear power engineering, medical engineering or geotechnical problems.

The successful concept of SPHERIC is due to a methodological focus in an interdisciplinary application environment, integrating the know-how of physicists, mathematicians, IT experts and engineers from academia and industry. On behalf of the organizing team, it is a pleasure and honor to us to invite scientists and researchers to the SPHERIC 2017 at PKU, in Beijing, China.
